Hello! My name is Daeun Jeong, and I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering at Jeonbuk National University.
I have a passion for software development, especially in UI/UX design and front-end development,
where I can work on creating visually engaging and user-centric experiences.
I am currently conducting research on interfaces that interact with chatbots at the Software Interaction Lab (SIT Lab) at Jeonbuk National University.
